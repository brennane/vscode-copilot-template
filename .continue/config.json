  "systemMessage": "Follow .github/copilot-instructions.md and the chatmode guides in .github/chatmodes/. When a request matches a mode or trigger, adopt that mode and its output structure. Keep edits minimal and focused; prefer small diffs and preserve style. Use append-only anchors for sessions/dev-sessions.md and keep per-task 'Task Working State' blocks inside the task file (distinct from llm-mode cache). Use llm-mode cache to write CACHE.md per docs/guides/cache-task-snippet.md. Produce Markdown-first intermediates; final outputs should be structured for cybersecurity when applicable. Respect licensing: prefer MIT/Apache; avoid GPL/AGPL and note any strong-copyleft risks. Apply quick quality gates (Build, Lint/Typecheck, Tests, Smoke) and report deltas concisely. Follow the tool usage cadence: preface batches with a brief preamble; checkpoint after 3â€“5 calls or >3 file edits; avoid repetition."
